# Teams Connector

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/teams_connector.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/teams_connector)
![RSpec](https://github.com/qurasoft/teams_connector/actions/workflows/ruby.yml/badge.svg)

Welcome to Teams Connector. This gem allows you to easily send messages from your ruby project to Microsoft Teams channels.
It integrates in your rails project, when you are using bundler or even in plain ruby projects.

The messages can be send synchronous or asynchronous with [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq). 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'teams_connector'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install teams_connector

## Usage
After setting up the Incoming Webhook Connector for your Microsoft Teams channel, it is as simple as configuring the channel and creating a new `TeamsConnector::Notification`.

The `channels` parameter can either be a single channel identifier or an array of multiple channel identifiers, that each will receive the notification. 

```ruby
# TeamsConnector initializer
TeamsConnector.configure do |config|
  config.channel :channel_id, "https://<YOUR COMPLETE WEBHOOK URL GOES HERE>"
end

# Send a test card to your channel
TeamsConnector::Notification.new(template: :test_card, channels: :channel_id).deliver_later

# Send a card with a list of facts
content = {
  title: "Teams Connector Readme",
  subtitle: "A list of facts",
  facts: {
    "Usage": "Testing the facts Card"
  }
}
TeamsConnector::Notification::Message.new(:facts_card, "This is a summary", content).deliver_later
```

### Secure Channel Configuration
Since the Incoming Webhook Connector does not allow any authentication at the endpoint it is crucial that you keep your channel urls secret.
At best nobody finds the url but it can also lead to spam or even faking of critical messages.

In Rails provides the credentials functionality for [environmental security](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#environmental-security). This mechanism can be used by TeamsConnector to load channels from an encrypted file. This also allows easy separation of production and development channel URLs.
All channels are defined under the top-level entry `teams_connector` and will be identified by their key.
```yaml
# $ bin/rails credentials:edit
teams_connector:
  default: "<INSERT DEFAULT URL HERE>"
  sales: "<INSERT URL FOR THE :sales CHANNEL HERE>"
```

After configuration of the credentials you can load the channels in your initializer.
Since `#load_from_rails_configuration` is a wrapper around `#channel` both methods can be used together.

```ruby
# TeamsConnector initializer
TeamsConnector.configure do |config|
  config.load_from_rails_credentials
  # After loading the :default channel is available and can be set as the default 
  config.default = :default
  config.channel :another_channel, "<URL>"
end
```

### Templates
This gem provides some basic templates in its default template path. You can also define your own templates in your own path.
The default templates will be still available so you can mix and match.

#### Default templates

| Template name  | Description                                                         |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| :adaptive_card | A card with the body of an adaptive card for more complex scenarios |
| :facts_card    | A card with title, subtitle and a list of facts                     |
| :test_card     | A simple text message without any configurable content for testing  |

#### Custom Templates

Custom templates are stored in the directory specified by the configuration option `template_dir`. As an array of strings, describing the path relative to the project root. When using Rails or Bundler their root is used, otherwise it is the current working directory.

Templates are json files with the extension `.json.erb`. The file is parsed and populated by the ruby ERB module.

#### Builder

You can use TeamsConnector::Builder to create Adaptive Cards directly in ruby. YOu can output the result of the builder as JSON for future use with `TeamsController::Notification::AdaptiveCard#pretty_print`.

```ruby
builder = TeamsConnector::Builder.container do |content|
  content << TeamsConnector::Builder.text("This is an introductory text for the following facts")
  content << TeamsConnector::Builder.facts { |facts|
    facts["Usage"] = "Testing the adaptive card builder"
    facts["Quokka fact"] = "They are funny little creatures"
  }
end

TeamsConnector::Notification::AdaptiveCard.new(content: builder).deliver_later
```

## Testing

To test TeamsConnector integration in your application you can use the `:testing` method.
Instead of performing real HTTP requests, an array in `TeamsConnector.testing.requests` is filled with your notifications in chronological order.

The request elements have the following structure:
```ruby
{
  channel: :default,
  template: :facts_card,
  content: '{"rendered content": "in JSON format"}',
  time: Time.now
}
```

### RSpec Matcher
TeamsConnector provides the `sent_notification_to?(channel = nil, template = nil)` matcher for RSpec.
It is available by adding `require "teams_connector/rspec"` to your `spec_helper.rb`.
The matcher supports filtering notifications by channel and template. If one is not given, it does not filter the notifications by it.
There exists the alias `send_notification_to` and `have_sent_notification_to` for `sent_notification_to?`.

```ruby
it "has sent exactly one notification to the channel" do
  expect { notification.deliver_later }.to sent_notification_to?(:channel)
end
```

#### Expecting number of notifications
By default `sent_notification_to?` expects exactly one matching notification.
You can change the expected amount by chaining `exactly`, `at_least` or `at_most`.

Example:
```ruby
it "has sent less than 10 notifications to the channel" do
  expect { notification.deliver_later }.to sent_notification_to?(:channel).at_most(10)
end
```

You can also use `once`, `twice` and `thrice` as an alias for `exactly(1..3)`.
For more readable expectations `times` can be chained.

#### Expecting templates
The template argument in the matcher does filter the notifications.
If you expect a template instead, you can chain with `with_template(:template)`.

#### Expecting content
To expect specific content, you can chain with `with(data = nil, &block)`.
Data supports other RSpec matchers like `hash_including`.
The block is called for every notification with the notification content hash and the raw notification itself.

Example:
```ruby
expect {
  notification(:default, :test_card).deliver_later
}.to sent_notification_to?(:default).with { |content, notification|
  expect(notification[:channel]).to eq :default
  expect(notification[:template]).to eq :test_card
  expect(content["sections"]).to include(hash_including("activityTitle", "activitySubtitle", "facts", "markdown" => true))
}
```
## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

You can define the channels you use for testing in the file `bin/channels.yml` or directly in the `bin/console` script.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
